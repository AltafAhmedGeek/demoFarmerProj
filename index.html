          <h2>SPOTTY RAINS DELIVER SOME RELIEF FROM HEAT</h2>
          <h3>CHAD HENDERSON – MADISON, ALABAMA</h3>
          <p>Chad Henderson is part of a fifth-generation farming operation in Madison, Alabama. Henderson Farms operates over 8,000 acres of dryland and irrigated corn, dryland soybeans, wheat, and dryland and irrigated double-crop soybeans. When not farming, Chad can be found carrying on another proud family tradition as a drag racer for Henderson Racing.

            After a month of dry, hot weather we finally got an inch of rain. It was not a widespread rain, but we hope it is enough to break the hot and dry weather pattern. There is rain in the forecast for later this week. Our Valley pivots are running continuously as we try to keep moisture in the ground at all times now. 
            
            Our double crop soybeans are looking very good. We had enough moisture in the ground when they were planted, and we have a full stand as a result. 
            
            Most of our corn is at the brown silk stage. It looks like our early planted corn is going to end up taking a yield hit due to heat and lack of rain. It was just too much for the plants to handle. Our fungicide will be going out later this week on all of our irrigated corn acres.

            <h3>LEE LUBBERS – GREGORY, SOUTH DAKOTA</h3>
            <p>Lee Lubbers of Gregory, South Dakota, grew up in the farming tradition, and remembers well using leftover scholarship money as the down payment for his first tractor and rent for 200 acres. Today, he farms more than 17,000 acres of dryland soybeans, corn, and wheat. Lubbers says one of the most important things to him is to always be learning and challenging himself to build an operation and a legacy that the next generation can be proud of.

                It’s the dog days of summer and we are getting our share of hot days. 95° to 105° F. with hot and dry wind seems to be the norm this year. 
                
                Rains have been spotty at best, and it has bypassed most of our crops. Precipitation has been hitting mostly north and to our west. It seems like there is no in between. It’s either a good rain or nothing at all. We did have a “mini-derecho” type storm pop up the other day. We were just at the edge of it and luckily no damage, some people were not as lucky in areas to our north and east. We heard reports of severe hail to our north and pretty substantial wind damage to the corn east of us.
